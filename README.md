Installing Mods

Make a folder called "Mods" in the IntoTheRadius/Content/Paks folder and place your mod .pak files in there.
Open Radiant before launching your game.

Making Mods
============

!! You must use an Unreal Engine 4.27.x version, 4.27.2 works fine.

Create a new Blueprint Project called IntoTheRadius (it must be called IntoTheRadius to work), choose no starter content

Create a new folder for your mod make the name of this folder the name of your mod, and inside make a new blueprint actor called ModActor.

Inside the Event Graph of your ModActor, Right Click and Add Custom Event and name it OnModLoaded, make another event and call it EngineTick

Now you want to go into your Editor Preferences, then search "chunk" and enable allow ChunkID assignments

Now in Project Settings, click Packaging on the left and enable Generate Chunks

Select all assets required by your mod (unless they are dummy bp's) and Right Click->Asset Actions->Assign to chunk and assign them to a number you'll remember.

Now you can package your project, and in your compiled content/paks folder one of the .pak files names will have your chunk number in it.

You MUST rename this to the name of the folder you put your mod actor in earlier so the mod loader can find it,
my folder was Radiant-Mod so the file will be Radiant-Mod.pak

Now in the game's files make a folder called "Mods" in the IntoTheRadius/Content/Paks/ and place your mod there
